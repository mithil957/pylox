- Lox is a scripting language -> executes directly from source

- How to use interpreter?
    - python lox.py {path_to_script} -> execute script stored somewhere
    - python lox.py -> REPL

- Separate code that generates error from code that reports it

- lexeme -> blob of characters where each blob represents something in the language

- lexical grammar -> rules that determine how to group characters into lexemes
    - if the lexical grammar is "simple" enough then it can be classified as a regular language

- maximal match -> when a grammar rule has overlapping matches, the rule that matches the most characters wins
    - 'or' vs 'orange' -> one is a operator the other a variable, 'orange' would win
